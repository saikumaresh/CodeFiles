# Design Hashmap

# https://unstop.com/code/challenge-assessment/250158?moduleId=445

# Problem Statement

# Bob, in a fit of anger, vowed to avoid using built-in libraries after an argument with a programming language developer. 
# He's attempting to create his own functions and data structures but got stuck while implementing a HashMap to map unique integer keys to integer values.

# He needs help to perform three basic operations:

# 1. Insert: Add or update a (key, value) pair.
# 2. Get: Print the value for a given key, or -1 if the key doesn't exist.
# 3. Delete: Remove a key and its corresponding value if present.

# Let's assist Bob in building his own HashMap without relying on any pre-existing hash table libraries.

# Input Format
# The first line of the input contains n, the number of queries.
# Each of the next n lines starts with integer t, the type of query.
# For type = 1, the line further contains 2 integers denoting the key and its corresponding value to be inserted.
# For type = 2, the line further contains a single integer denoting the key whose value is to be printed.
# For type = 3, the line further contains a single integer denoting the key that is to be deleted.

# Output Format
# For queries of type 2, print a single integer â€“ value corresponding to the given key.

# Constraints
# 1 <= n <= 104
# 0 <= key, value <= 109

# All the queries are orderly dependent.

# There will be at least one type 2 query.

# In type 3 queries, it is guaranteed that the key given is present in the map at the moment.

# Sample Testcase 0

# Testcase Input
# 8
# 1 1 1
# 1 2 2
# 2 1
# 2 3
# 1 2 1
# 2 2
# 3 2
# 2 2

# Testcase Output
# 1
# -1
# 1
# -1

# Explanation
# For query 1, we insert (1, 1). Our map is now [(1, 1)]
# For query 2, we insert (2, 2). Our map is now [(1, 1), (2, 2)]
# For query 3, we print value corresponding to key 1, i.e., 1
# For query 4, we do not have the key 3 in our map, hence we print -1
# For query 5, we update the value corresponding to key 2 to 1. Out map now is [(1, 1), (2, 1)]
# For query 6, we print the value corresponding to key 2, i.e., 1
# For query 7, we delete the key 2 from the map. Out map now is [(1, 1)]
# For query 8. we do not have the key 2 in our map anymore, hence we print -1


# Sample Testcase 1

# Testcase Input
# 9
# 1 4 2
# 1 25 6
# 2 4
# 1 4 8
# 2 25
# 3 25
# 2 25
# 1 25 1
# 2 25

# Testcase Output
# 2
# 6
# -1
# 1

# Explanation
# For query 1, we insert (4, 2). Our map is now [(4, 2)]
# For query 2, we insert (25, 6). Our map is now [(4, 2), (25, 6)]
# For query 3, we print value corresponding to key 4, i.e., 2
# For query 4, we update the value corresponding to key 4 to 8. Out map now is [(4, 8), (25, 6)]
# For query 5, we print the value corresponding to key 25, i.e., 6
# For query 6, we delete the key 25 from the map. Out map now is [(4, 8)]
# For query 7, we do not have the key 25 in our map anymore, hence we print -1
# For query 8. we insert (25, 1). Our map is now [(4, 8), (25, 1)]
# For query 9, we print the value corresponding to key 25, i.e., 1
