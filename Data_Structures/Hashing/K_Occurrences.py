# K Occurrences

# Problem Statement
# Groot has N trees lined up in front of him where the height of the i'th tree is denoted by H[i].
# He wants to select some trees to replace his broken branches.
# But he wants uniformity in his selection of trees.
# So he picks only those trees whose heights have frequency B.
# He then sums up the heights that occur B times. (He adds the height only once to the sum and not B times).
# But the sum he ended up getting was huge so he prints it modulo 10^9+7.
# In case no such cluster exists, Groot becomes sad and prints -1.

# Constraints:
# 1.   1<=N<=100000
# 2.   1<=B<=N
# 3.   0<=H[i]<=10^9

# Input: Integers N and B and an array C of size N

# Output: Sum of all numbers in the array that occur exactly B times.

# Example:

# Input:
# N=5 ,B=2 ,C=[1 2 2 3 3]

# Output:
# 5

# Explanation:
# There are 3 distinct numbers in the array which are 1,2,3.
# Out of these, only 2 and 3 occur twice. Therefore the answer is sum of 2 and 3 which is 5.

class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @param B : integer
    # @param C : list of integers
    # @return an integer
